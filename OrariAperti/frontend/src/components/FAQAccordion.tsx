                        Reservations can only be made for available rooms and valid time slots. The system prevents
                        overlapping bookings and ensures that the start time is before the end time. Reservations cannot
                        be made in the past. The participant field only allows letters, spaces, and commas.

                        If you lose your private key, you will not be able to edit or delete your reservation.
                        Similarly, if you lose your public key, you cannot share the reservation for viewing unless you
                        still have the private key. Then you can restore the public key by entering the private and
                        copying the public one.
                        <br/><br/>For security reasons, we cannot recover lost keys. You will need to create a new
                        reservation if necessary.
